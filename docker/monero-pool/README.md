These expect the following folder structure on your Docker host:

 */data/monero/wallet*    # should contain a wallet file generated by monerod-wallet-cli
 
 */data/monero/chain*     # should contain completly synced blockchain

Run the following to boot up redis and monerod:

> ./start.sh

The included monerod container will take care of syncing the block chain into
aforementioned folders. While this procedure is still in process, the pool cannot
operate and may not recover from the coind being busy without restart in most
cases. Thus keep an eye on it using:

> docker logs -f monerod

When the blockchain is synced entirely, your wallet is created etc just run:

> ./start-pool.sh.
