This is an after installation  pack for the second generation Xiaomi MiBook Air 13".

My exact specs for this config were:

	CPU: Intel i5-7200
	GPU: Intel HD620 / Nvidia MX150
	RAM: 8GB DDR4
	SSD: 128GB SATA3

This may or may not work on other models.

What works:
	- QE/CI for HD620
	- Audio
	- Touchpad
	- Backlight/Volume via hotkeys
	- Bluetooth

What doesn't work:
	- Nvidia GPU (optimus so no dice)
	- Wifi (intel chipset)

Folders:
	- ./EFI => An overlay for an existing CLOVER install
	- ./Library => All Kexts you will need to put into /Library/Extensions after completing the installation.
