This is an after installation  pack for the second generation Xiaomi MiBook Air 13".

My exact specs for this config were:

	CPU: Intel i5-7200
	GPU: Intel HD620 / Nvidia MX150
	RAM: 8GB DDR4
	SSD: 128GB SATA3
	AUDIO: Realtek ALC255

This may or may not work on other models.

What works:
	- QE/CI for HD620
	- Audio
	- Touchpad
	- Backlight/Volume via hotkeys
	- Sensors (CPU, HDD, S.M.A.R.T etc)
	- Camera
	- Bluetooth (but untested)

What doesn't work:
	- Nvidia GPU (optimus so no dice)
	- Wifi (intel chipset)
	- Fingerprint sensor (haven't bothered)

Folders:
	- ./EFI => An overlay for an existing CLOVER install
	- ./Library => All Kexts you will need to put into /Library/Extensions after completing the installation.
	- ./Info => Various potentially useful information
